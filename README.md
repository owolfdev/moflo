Supabase Pagination

To fetch only the necessary data while preserving pagination in your web app, you can use the OFFSET and LIMIT clauses provided by Supabase. These clauses allow you to specify the starting point and the number of records to retrieve from your table.

Here's a step-by-step approach to implement pagination with Supabase:

1. Determine the page size: Decide how many records you want to display per page. In your case, you mentioned displaying 10 items per page.

2. Calculate the OFFSET: Multiply the page size by the page number minus 1 to determine the starting point of each page. For example, for page 1, the offset would be 0 (10 _ (1 - 1) = 0), for page 2, the offset would be 10 (10 _ (2 - 1) = 10), and so on.

3. Fetch data using OFFSET and LIMIT: Use the OFFSET and LIMIT clauses in your Supabase query to retrieve the data for the current page. The OFFSET specifies the starting point, and the LIMIT specifies the number of records to fetch. For example:

```javascript
const pageSize = 10 // Number of items per page
const pageNumber = 1 // Current page number

const offset = (pageNumber - 1) * pageSize

const { data, error } = await supabase
  .from("your_table_name")
  .select("*")
  .offset(offset)
  .limit(pageSize)
```

This query will fetch the required data for the specified page size and offset.

4. Display the fetched data in your web app: Once you receive the data from Supabase, you can display it in your paginated view, showing the relevant records for the current page.

5. Implement navigation: To navigate between pages, you can use the page size and the total number of records in your table. Calculate the total number of pages by dividing the total number of records by the page size. Use this information to provide next/previous buttons or links to move to the desired page. You can also include other navigation options such as page numbers or a dropdown to select a specific page.

By utilizing OFFSET and LIMIT in your queries, you can fetch the required data for each page while maintaining pagination in your web app.

To get the total number of records in a table using Supabase, you can make use of the `.count()` method in your Supabase query. Here's an example of how you can retrieve the total number of records:

```javascript
const { count, error } = await supabase
  .from("your_table_name")
  .select("*", { count: "exact" })

const totalRecords = count // Total number of records in the table
```

In the above code, the `count` method is used to retrieve the count of records in the specified table. The `{ count: 'exact' }` option ensures an exact count is returned. The result is stored in the `count` variable, and you can access the total number of records using `count.count`.

Note that using `count()` can be an expensive operation on large tables as it scans the entire table. If you have a large dataset, it's recommended to use caching or other optimization techniques to avoid unnecessary count queries for every pagination request.
